<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sai Chandra Dhulipati Suresh, a T-Level student in Digital Support Services (Cybersecurity) at Milton Keynes College,
with a strong interest in information security, networking, and emerging technologies. I am actively building both
technical and professional skills through hands-on projects, certifications, and real-world industry experience.</p>

<p>I have completed work experience placements at Ocado Technology and TNEI and am currently volunteering with Cyber
Helpline, where I support users with cybersecurity awareness and digital safety. My technical learning includes
Python programming, web development, networking fundamentals, and cybersecurity tools, alongside ongoing preparation
for certifications such as CompTIA Network+ and Security+.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am an active member of Toastmasters, which has strengthened my communication and leadership skills.
I enjoy continuous learning across multiple disciplines, including languages, music, and technology, and I am working
towards a career in cybersecurity through degree apprenticeships and industry-focused opportunities. My goal is to
become a highly skilled and responsible cybersecurity professional.</p>
